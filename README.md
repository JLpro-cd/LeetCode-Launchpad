# LeetCode Launchpad

## Introduction
- This is a project I started working on in order to gain some more experience with React and Django while deepening my understanding of LeetCode-related concepts.
- LeetCode Launchpad is tailored for those new to technical interview preparation, providing a focused introduction to LeetCode problem categories and essential Python concepts.
- The emphasis is on problem-solving 'tricks' and memorization of abstract patterns.
- This is still a work in progress, not all content is finished yet!

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework
- **Database**: SQLite (PostgreSQL planned for production)
- **Authentication**: Django's built-in user authentication system

## Features
- Explore specific data structures or problem categories through detailed examples with step-by-step explanations.
- Utilize flashcards to master the time complexities of various methods associated with the most used Python data structures.

## Planned Features
- Spaced repetition for flashcards to enhance retention.
- Progress tracking for completed problem categories.
- OpenAI GPT assistant to provide hints and explanations for Leetcode problems (API key integration and secure storage).
- **Deployment**: Plan to deploy the app using AWS with PostgreSQL for production.

## Installation - Now defunct since switching to Django, will update soon! Likely, will be deployed by then as mentioned above.
